                //JSON
//JSON stands for 'javascript object notation'. JSON does not mean that data is in the form of javascript,it is a formate that responsed data will be in JSON formate.Before JSON, data was returned in another formate known as XML,which stands for extensable markup language.
//When we see JSON formate data then it looks like objects in javascript but it is different from javascript objects for example we can't write strings as key in objects in js but in JSON formate key is always a string.In js Objects any key can contains some undefined value but in JSON there no key with undefined data.
//To study more about JSON go to website -> www.json.org
//We can also check whether given data is in correct JSON formate or not.For checking we use 'JSON Validator' on google.
