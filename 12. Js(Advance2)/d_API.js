//API stands for 'Application programming interface'.We can understand an API like a waiter.It gets some request from client and send it to server and then server gives a response which is received by API and then API send this response to client.When we want to interact between two softwares then we interact between them with the help of API bwtween them.But API's which uses http protocols mean APIs which help in interaction on the basis of internet are called Web APIs.
//When user sends some request to server then API gets this request and sends it to server,server send some response to API and then this API sends received data from server in some special formate called JSON formate.
//There are many APIs which we can use without any cost.There is an API of twitter through which we can send auto reponse whenever any post mentions our account etc.For using some APIs we need to insert key(password) and they are paid ,some are free for some days and after a time interval they ask for mone.
