//Ajax term stands for 'asynchronous javascript and XML'. It means that our APIs response to request asynchronouly and returns data in XML form ,basically the formate of data is JSON not XML but in Ajax 'x' stands for XML.The reason is that as we know before JSON formate date was returned in XML form and in those days this term was invented Ajax and now we can say it Ajaj(asynchronous javascript and JSON) but pronouncing it looks some strange.
//So basically Ajax means that we are calling APIs and these calls are working asynchronously and we are getting some response from some calls with whome we are dealing.
//For example if we like a photo on insta/fb then we will see that it will increase count of likes but our page will not be reloaded this is due to Ajax mean we caaling our API asynchronously which performs some work without changing other things.
//We can also take it as like we call an API and it is taking some time to response so it does not mean that our code will stop until it receives response from our API.It will continue executing and when it will get response from API it will perfomr operation according to this response.
