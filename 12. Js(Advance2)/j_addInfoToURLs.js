//we can add information to URLs.For example if we want to search on google,then we will go to our browser and will search google.com. Page of google will come and then in search bar we will search for what we want.Lets suppose we search for mango.Then we will write mango in search section and google will return some data in response.
//But we can directly add info to this URL for searching mango on browser for example if we write 'google.com/search?q=mango' then our browser will open google and mango's data will come to page. Here in this URL we have added some info.We pass information in the form of 'key value' pairs and this pair just after question mark is known as 'querry string'.Here q is key and mango is value.We can add any value to this key for what we want to search.
//So we use this method when we have to add information to our url.
//Lets explore an API which is 'https://api.potterdb.com/'.This api contains all the data of harry potter movies like their name,length,budget,producers,editors etc.We can go to this api and this will return all the data it contains and we can look into this for what we want to see but instead of looking a lot of data we can add info to this url for searching specific data.For example if we want to get info about movies only then we can go to 'routes' and there we will find a route for movies.There we will find a route '/v1/movies' we can add it to our api and this return data of all movies.But if we want to get data of a single specific movie,then for this we sea route in routes section which is 'v1/movies/:id' here id a variable which will be replaced by id of the movie and when we will replace it with the id of movies and call for this api request we get data about this movies only.Like there is a movie with id 'ef0becd6-ba4f-45de-aed6-e9442a2e433e' so for searching this specific id's movie we can call 'https://api.potterdb.com/v1/movies/ef0becd6-ba4f-45de-aed6-e9442a2e433e' and this will return all the data of this movie.
//Note: At any url/api if we see urlName/:id or urlName/:number or urlName/{{someVarName}} or urlName/<anyVarName> ,then by these symbols we mean it is a variable's name to which we have to replace by some specific value,like here id is a variable which will be replaced by id of movie.

//There is another interesting API 'http://universities.hipolabs.com'.This API contains data of  the universities of some countries.If we want to search for pakistian universities then we can write 'http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=Pakistan' all the data of universities in pakistan.
//If we write 'http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=Pakistan&state=Delhi' , then this will return data of pakistan universities and there will be no error generated fo state delhi as there is no state named as delhi in pakistan so our API will ignore it.
